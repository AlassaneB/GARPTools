Description: The GARPTools package provides tools to prepare data for input into DesktopGARP (the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction) and for the 
    evaluation of the accuracy of output models. GARP is a software package for biodiversity and ecological research that allows the user to predict 
    and analyze wild species distributions. GARP is a presence-only genetic algorithm that models species’ potential geographic distributions through 
    an iterative process of training and testing that occurs through resampling and replacement of input data.
